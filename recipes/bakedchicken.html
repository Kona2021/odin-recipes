    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You'll need a large, heavy-duty roasting pan (or a couple of smaller ones) and a very hot oven for this delicious dish. The long oven time makes everything beautifully caramelized and the chicken fork tender. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large links hot Italian sausage</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>½ pound assorted sweet peppers, seeded</li>
        <li>1 small red onion, sliced</li>
        <li>½ yellow onion, sliced</li>
        <li>4 large Yukon Gold potatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried Italian herbs</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook sausage links until browned and oil begins to render, about 3 minutes per side. While sausages are cooking, pierce them lightly here and there with the tip of a sharp knife so some fats and juices are released. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>When sausages are cool enough to handle, cut them into serving pieces, about 2-inch slices. Transfer back to pan along with any accumulated juices from the cutting board.</li>
        <li>Cut two slashes down to the bone on the skin side of each chicken thigh.</li>
        <li>Depending on the size of the peppers, halve or quarter them and place in a large mixing bowl. Add the sliced red and yellow onions and potato chunks. Add chicken thighs and sausage pieces with pan juices.</li>
        <li>Season with kosher salt, black pepper, and Italian herbs. Drizzle with a tablespoon of olive oil.</li>
        <li>Mix with your hands until all ingredients are coated in oil, 3 or 4 minutes. Transfer to large, heavy-duty roasting pan. Evenly space the chicken thighs skin side up. Position potatoes near the top.</li>
        <li>Place in preheated oven until chicken is cooked through and everything is caramelized, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with chopped fresh Italian parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
